## 🌳 Intro

The Sanskrit language is world's oldest language.
Sanskrit had been the language in use from the Vedic period.
According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period) The Vedic period was from c.1500 to c.500 BCE 😂 but belive me its much more older that. Once Rick Briggs, a researcher at NASA wrote a paper in 1985 titled [Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/466). claims that Sanskrit is the most suitable language to develop computer programming for their Artificial Intelligence program. The grammar of Sanskrit is rule-bound, formula-bound, and logical, which makes it highly appropriate to write algorithms. So considering that Vedic designed to be a high-level, logical scripting language. 

> **Fun-Fect** : Basically vedic language was not originally my idea, its credit also goes to [Christopher Nolan](https://twitter.com/chris_nolann?lang=en)'s **Interstellar (2014)**, Early in the movie during drone scene our protagonist **Cooper** hack the drone with his laptop, If you see closely there is Sanskrit written all over the screen, maybe because that Indian surveillance drone was programmed in Sanskrit only. so after that seen this thought came to my mind. Why don't we actually make a programming language in Sanskrit. so here is it.
